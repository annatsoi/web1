 “So that chemistry was real because you all really did have feelings like that,” said DeGeneres.
 Reeves nodded his head in agreement. “It was nice to go to work,” he said.<strong> “She’s such a wonderful person, and actress"</strong>
<br> <br>Reeves said he had no idea Bullock had feelings for him.

 <p>The talk show host was so shocked the actors never revealed their feelings for each other.
  “I can’t believe you both had crushes on each other and were so scared,” said DeGeneres.
  Reeves explained why the two never pursued a relationship. “We were working!” said the actor.
DeGeneres wasn’t buying Reeves’ excuse.
“Haven’t you ever had a romance with someone you did a movie with?” asked DeGeneres.
Reeves made a few funny faces and fidgeted a bit, so DeGeneres said she took that as a “yes.”
