<h2>Celebrity</h2>

<p>
Celebrity is the fame and public attention accorded by the mass media to individuals or groups or,
occasionally, animals, but is usually applied to the persons or groups of people (celebrity couples, families, etc.)
themselves who receive such a status of fame and attention.
Celebrity status is often associated with wealth (commonly referred to as fame and fortune),
while fame often provides opportunities to earn revenue.
